## Coding Challenge

## What I completed 

- [ ] I used React.js instead of Vue.js
- [ ] I used CSS Module. An example of file is `style.module.css`
- [ ] I could display a list of articles on the left side and the article details on the right side.
- [ ] The use only see a text on the right side by default. If they click one article on the left, they will see the detail of article they clicked on.
- [ ] By default a text as "Unread article" is displayed in each article on the left side. As soons as a user clicks on an article, this text will be changed to "Read article".
- [ ] I made the page responsive
- [ ] I run the api to get the data instead of using graphQl.
